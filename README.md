Streamlit Data Applications Showcase


This repository contains a collection of Python scripts demonstrating various features of the Streamlit library for building interactive data-driven web applications. The examples range from simple data displays to a complete machine learning-powered classification app.
üåü Key Features
Basic Data Display: Demonstrates how to display text, DataFrames, and charts (app.py).
Interactive UI Widgets: Includes examples of sliders, text input fields, select boxes, and file uploaders (widgets.py).
Machine Learning Integration: A complete end-to-end example of an interactive ML application that uses a trained Scikit-learn model to make real-time predictions based on user input (classification_project.py).
Data Visualization: Simple line charts to visualize data.
Data Caching: Efficient data loading using Streamlit's caching mechanism (@st.cache_data).
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Framework: Streamlit
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Language: Python
üöÄ Getting Started

Install the required libraries:
Create a requirements.txt file with the following content:
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn

Then, run the command below to install them:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Running the Applications
Each .py file is a standalone Streamlit application. You can run them using the streamlit run command.
Simple Streamlit App (app.py)
streamlit run app.py


Interactive Widgets Demo (widgets.py)
streamlit run widgets.py


Iris Flower Classification Project (classification_project.py)
streamlit run classification_project.py
